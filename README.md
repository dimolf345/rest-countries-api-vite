## My process

### Built with

- Vite App
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)

### What I learned

In this challenge, my second React Project, I tried to understand how to structure a React project using Vite App react template.
I started to code after watching part of Zero To Mastery (ZTM) course [React Developer 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/). Since this is a very long course I decided to try to develop a project to practice what I learned.

### Continued development

This project is far from being completed, but the main features requested by the challenge are working. I will definetely improve code readability and component reusability.

### Useful resources

- [React-Dropdown Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dropdown) - I learned that is really difficult to create a stateful dropdown component in React from scratch. So, unless you want to reinvent the wheel, take a look!
